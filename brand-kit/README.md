# Etyme brand kit — for the dashboard

This folder is the hand-off from the marketing site to the product. It carries how things
look: colours, type, corners, shadows, motion, the logo, the icons and every component the
site uses. It carries nothing about what the product does. Applying it changes the surface of
the dashboard and nothing underneath.

A live version of everything here is the page `brand-kit.html` on the marketing site
(repository `smadavaram/etyme-2017`, branch `development`), which is also where this folder
is maintained. This copy is for the dashboard's own repository.

## Rules for the thread that applies this

1. **Only the surface changes.** Tokens, stylesheet, class names, icons, logo. No change to
   routes, data, database, permissions, seats, menus' contents, or any relationship between
   companies, people and documents.
2. **The sidebar and header keep their structure.** Sections, sub-groups, items, the company
   block, the "+ New" menu, search, the phone drawer: all stay as built. They take the kit's
   colours, type, spacing and icons, nothing else.
3. **Replace, do not add alongside.** Where the product has a token or class that the kit also
   has, the kit's value wins. Old names stay so nothing breaks; their values change.
4. **Verify at 390px** on every screen touched. Nothing scrolls sideways except a table in its
   own box.
5. **Plain English on screen.** Sentence case, no metaphors, buttons say the verb and the thing.
6. **Where this meets CLAUDE.md.** Its design-system section says the prototypes in `prototypes/`
   are the standard. For colour, type, corners, shadows, motion, icons and the logo, this kit now
   is; the prototypes still decide layout, screens and behaviour. Do not edit CLAUDE.md for this;
   the product owner will.

## Tokens

### Colour

One warm cream ground. No dark mode. Text is ink, never pure black. Lines are rule, never grey.

| Token | Hex | Where |
|---|---|---|
| canvas | `#F0EEE6` | page background |
| surface | `#FBFAF7` | panels, the rail, table row hover, modal footers |
| raised | `#FFFFFF` | cards, inputs, menus, modals, drawers |
| sunk | `#E7E4DA` | hover fill on nav items and secondary buttons, meters, skeletons |
| ink | `#1F1E1D` | text, active tab underline, active segment fill, tooltips |
| muted | `#6B6862` | secondary text, nav items at rest, hints |
| faint | `#9C9891` | eyebrows, column headers, placeholders, counts |
| rule | `#E3DFD5` | every border and divider |

Brand strength, for the logo, primary buttons, links and the focus ring:

| Token | Hex |
|---|---|
| violet | `#5228FF` |
| violet hover | `#3F16E8` |
| violet pressed | `#3512C4` |
| orange | `#E16400` (logo, the rule beside a quotation) |
| green | `#00C800` (logo only) |

Product strength, for chips, active navigation, dots and small text:

| Token | Hex | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| violet-p | `#4421D6` | action, mine, current |
| orange-p | `#C0622E` | attention, waiting |
| green-p | `#2F7D3E` | verified, signed, matched |
| danger | `#B83A3A` | refused, blocked, error |

Washes and lines, for chip fills and borders, the active nav fill and the focus halo:

| Tone | Wash | Line |
|---|---|---|
| violet | `#EDE9FF` | `#C7CDF5` |
| orange | `#F7EDE6` | `#E5C9B5` |
| green | `#EDF1ED` | `#C9D6CA` |
| danger | `#FDE8E8` | `#F0C0C0` |

### What changes in the product's palette

| Product today | Becomes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| action `#2B47E5` (blue) | violet `#5228FF` for buttons and links; violet-p `#4421D6` for chips, active nav, small text | one brand colour on both surfaces |
| action wash `#EDEFFC` / line `#C7CDF5` | `#EDE9FF` / `#C7CDF5` | violet wash |
| verified `#4F6F52` | green-p `#2F7D3E` | the site's green |
| attention `#C0622E`, danger `#B83A3A` | unchanged | |
| canvas, surface, raised, ink, muted, faint, rule | unchanged | already the same |
| navy `#0D1426`, cyan `#00D4FF`, purple `#7C3AED` | removed | the logo is the SVG in `logo/`; the CSS-drawn "t" with a cyan→purple gradient in `components/logo.tsx` is replaced by it |
| the sidebar's active item (canvas fill, ink text) | violet wash fill, violet-p text, semibold | the site's current-page state |
| text-glyph icons in the sidebar (↻ ⇄ ⊘ ⊙ ⊞ …) | SVG icons from `icons.svg` at 15px | one icon language |

### Type

| Token | Stack | Where |
|---|---|---|
| serif | Iowan Old Style, Palatino Linotype, Palatino, Georgia, **Gelasio**, serif | headings, page titles, tile numbers, big figures. Regular weight, never bold, tight letter-spacing |
| sans | **Inter**, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, sans-serif | everything read or clicked |
| mono | **IBM Plex Mono**, ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, monospace | numbers in columns, dates, ids, codes, keyboard keys, footnotes |

Load from Google Fonts: Gelasio 400–600, Inter 400–700, IBM Plex Mono 400–500. In Next.js use
`next/font/google` for all three and expose them as `--font-gelasio`, `--font-inter`,
`--font-mono`. The product loads JetBrains Mono today; swap it for IBM Plex Mono.

Type scale:

| Name | Size / line | Family | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| hero | 42–54px / 1.08 | serif | letter-spacing −.025em, `text-wrap: balance` |
| display (page title) | 31px / 1.15 | serif | −.02em |
| h2 | 27px / 1.15 | serif | −.02em |
| heading | 22px / 1.2 | serif | modal titles, gate titles |

| chip | 10px / 1.5, 600, .04em, uppercase | sans | |

Tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) wherever digits line up.

### Corners, shadows, motion

| Token | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| r | 8px | buttons, inputs, cards, panels, tiles, toasts, menus |
| r-lg | 12px | shells, modals, drawers, figures, command palette, capability tiles |
| nav | 6px | rail items, pager buttons, menu items |
| chip | 5px | chips |
| box | 4px | checkboxes, kbd, focus corners |
| pill | 99px | filter pills, badges, meters, switches |

| ease | `cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1)` | the only curve |

Reduced motion turns every transition off.

## Components

## Icons

Line icons on a 24-unit grid, stroke 1.8, round caps and joins, `currentColor`. Sizes: 15px in
the rail, 16px in buttons and chips, 18px in menus, 26px on capability tiles. In the rail an
icon sits at 60% opacity and goes to 100% on the current item.

`icons.svg` holds the set as `<symbol id="i-…">`. Names:

arrow-left, arrow-right, bell, block, book, briefcase, building, calendar, chat, check,
chevron-down, chevron-left, chevron-right, chevron-up, clock, close, compliance, contract, copy,
database, download, edit, expense, external, eye, factory, filter, flag, grid, home, id-card,
info, integration, invoice, lanes, link, list, lock, logout, mail, menu, more, network, payment,
phone, plus, refresh, report, requisition, search, send, settings, shield, sign, star, swap,
timesheet, trash, upload, user, users, warn.

Draw any missing icon in the same style. No emoji, no filled icons, no text glyphs, no second
icon set.

## Logo

- `wordmark.svg`: "etyme" in ink; the crossbar of the t is three rising strokes in violet
  `#5228FF`, orange `#E16400`, green `#00C800`.
- `wordmark-on-dark.svg`: white letters, same strokes. Only on a dark band (`#1F1E1D`).
- `mark.svg`: the strokes alone. Favicon, rail header beside the name at 28px.
- Heights: 26px in the site header, 22px in a running head, 40px on sign-in, 28px mark in a rail.
- Clear space: one x-height all round. Never recoloured, stretched, given a gradient or put in a circle.

## Layout

- Content width 1180px on the site, 1200px in the dashboard; 20–24px side gutters, 16px on a phone.
- Rail 186–220px, surface, rule on its right; hidden under 900px, then a drawer from the menu button.
- Breakpoints: 900px (rail and site nav fold), 820px (grids to one column), 480px (tiles to one column).
- 8px spacing steps; groups use `gap`, not margins. Cards pad 22px, tiles 14px, table cells 12×10px.
- Tables and drawings scroll inside their own `overflow-x: auto` box. The page never scrolls sideways.

## Words on screen

- Plain English, sentence case, no metaphors. Eyebrows and chips are the only capitals.
- A rule is one present-tense sentence naming who and what: "Nobody signs their own week."
- A button is the verb and the thing: "Raise requisition", "Export CSV". Never "Submit", "OK".
- Numbers keep their unit and their date. Money has two decimals and a currency.
- An empty screen says what belongs there and how to add the first one.
- An error says what to do next, not what went wrong inside.

## How to apply it, in order

1. `tailwind.config.ts`: replace `colors.etyme`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `borderRadius` with
   `tailwind.tokens.ts`. Add `boxShadow`, `transitionDuration`, `transitionTimingFunction`.
2. `globals.css`: replace the `:root` block with `tokens.css`; point `--color-action` at
   `--violet`, `--color-verified` at `--green-p`. Re-style `.chip--*`, `.btn-primary`,
   `.btn-secondary`, `.filter-tab`, `.data-table`, `.stat-*`, `.panel`, `.card`, `.page-head`
   to the values in the table above. Focus ring: 2px `--violet`, offset 2px.
3. Fonts: load Gelasio, Inter and IBM Plex Mono with `next/font/google`; expose as
   `--font-gelasio`, `--font-inter`, `--font-mono`.
4. Logo: replace `components/logo.tsx` output with `logo/wordmark.svg` (and `mark.svg`); delete
   the navy/cyan/purple tokens.
5. Sidebar and header: keep every section, item and menu. Apply the rail item, rail group, rail
   and header bar looks; swap glyph icons for `icons.svg` at 15px.
6. Everything else by the component table, screen by screen. Add refusal, toast, empty state and
   skeleton where a screen has none.
7. Check every touched screen at 390px and with the keyboard.

## Open questions for the product owner

1. Buttons and links in the dashboard: violet `#5228FF` (as on the site) or the deeper
   `#4421D6`? The kit says `#5228FF` for buttons, `#4421D6` for small text and chips.
2. Verified green: move to the site's `#2F7D3E`, or keep the product's sage `#4F6F52`?
   The kit says move.
3. Dark mode: the kit has none. Stay on one cream ground?
4. The sidebar's active item: violet wash (site) or the current canvas fill? The kit says violet wash.
